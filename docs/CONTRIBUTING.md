# Contributing to Sai

First off, thank you for your interest in Sai! As this project is in early active development, we're currently focused
on stabilizing the core functionality and architecture. During this phase, we're primarily seeking bug reports rather
than code contributions.

## Current Development Status

Kﾅ行hi is under active development, and many core features are still being designed and implemented. The API and internal
architecture may undergo significant changes. As such, we're being selective about external contributions to maintain
development velocity and architectural consistency.

## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

Bug reports are highly valuable to us during this phase. If you encounter any issues, please submit them via GitHub
Issues. When submitting a bug report, please include:

1. **Ruby Version**: The version of Ruby you're using
2. **Kﾅ行hi Version**: The version of Kﾅ行hi where you encountered the issue
3. **Terminal Environment**: Your terminal emulator and operating system
4. **Description**: A clear description of what happened versus what you expected
5. **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
6. **Code Sample**: A minimal code example that demonstrates the issue
7. **Terminal Output**: Any relevant error messages or unexpected output
8. **Screenshots**: If applicable, screenshots showing the issue (especially for layout-related bugs)

### Feature Requests

While we're focused on core development, we welcome feature suggestions via GitHub Issues. Please note that feature
requests may be deferred until after the initial stable release.

### Code Contributions

At this time, we are not accepting pull requests for new features or significant changes. This policy will be revised as
the project matures. However, we may accept small fixes for critical bugs - please open an issue first to discuss.

## Development Roadmap

Our current focus is on:
- Stabilizing the core grid layout engine
- Implementing basic theming capabilities
- Establishing a consistent, intuitive API
- Comprehensive testing across different terminal environments
