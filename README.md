An elegant color management system for crafting sophisticated CLI applications

Sai (å½©) - meaning 'coloring' or 'paint' in Japanese - is a powerful and intuitive system for managing color output in
command-line applications. Drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese artistic techniques, Sai brings vibrancy and
harmony to terminal interfaces through its sophisticated color management. 

Sai empowers developers to create beautiful, colorful CLI applications that maintain visual consistency across different
terminal capabilities. Like its artistic namesake, it combines simplicity and sophistication to bring rich, adaptive 
color to your terminal interfaces.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'sai'
